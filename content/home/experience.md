This has necessitated the creation of mass campaigns to obtain information from numerous individuals, from personal information collection to a variety of voting procedures, all of which has enabled me to accurately and reliably present issues to faculty and find adequate resolutions that benefit the class. This has necessitated a high degree of personal commitment to organisation, requiring the creation of specialized calendars, centralized resources and broadcast channels through various social media, all of which have ensured rapid mobilization of information and sharing of related resources. This has in recent years evolved to include full curriculum reviews as well as suggestions that have fed back into the creation of an improved medical syllabus."""
